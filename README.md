### Dependancies

I needed quickstarts for all the operating systems i use. This includes 
  - Mac OSX (Usually 1 major release behind the latest release)
  - Windows 10 (Desktop)
  - Linux (Unbuntu, CentOS, SunOS, Arch)

### Installation

#### Mac OSX - Lion +

You need to have installed
[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=xcode) or, at the
very minimum, the [XCode Command Line
Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools),
which are available as a _much smaller_ download thank Apple.

#### Ubuntu Notes


#### Windows


#### Architecture

The install scripts should be native (what came with) and a one-line for everything, or atleast
clone and one-command.

That means
  - **nix -> bash/sh
  - win -> powershell?

#### Mac OS X

install homebrew
installs brew apps
  symlink vimrc, zshrc, oh-my-zsh
  custom zsh stuff
  nvm
  rvm
install brew casks
